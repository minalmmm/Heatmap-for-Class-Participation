- **Inactive Student Identification**: Identifies students with low participation based on a customizable threshold.
- **Interactive Participation Threshold**: Allows the user to adjust the threshold for identifying inactive students using a slider.

## Requirements

The app requires the following libraries:
- **Streamlit**: For creating the interactive web interface.
- **Pandas**: For reading and manipulating data.
- **Seaborn**: For creating the heatmap.
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting the heatmap.
